# Office products spawning WMIC
This analytic will look for Potential WMIC Abuse. Windows Management Instrumentation Command retrieves a huge range of information about local or remote computers. Makes configuration changes to multiple remote machines. The WMIC is a deprecated tool as of 2021. While it is unlikely to stop working for a few years, no new features will be added and it may eventually be removed. WMIC is a Feature on Demand (FoD) that's preinstalled by default in Windows 11.

### Things of Note: 
    - /NODE: which is used to connect to remote devices. this can show up in any of the scenarios. 
    - /FORMAT: Executes JScript or VBScript embedded in the target remote XSL stylesheet.

### Office products spawning WMIC:
Itâ€™s almost always malicious when wmic.exe spawns as a child process of Microsoft Office and similar products. As such, it makes sense to examine the chain of execution and follow-on activity when this occurs.

Office apps shouldn't run WMIC commands. This should be reported right away. if this is happening it is likely a "macro" setup on the office file. Malicious macros are often used. the only exception I have seen is when the command run was something like opening excel without any additional parameters. 

### Red Flags: 
1. reaching out to the internet 
2. obfuscated code (base64, rot13, etc)
3. any kind of encryption taking place on the device
