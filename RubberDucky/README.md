# Rubber Ducky scripts
## if you see arduino files (*.ino) it is for the Attiny85 which is a lot cheaper than the rubberducky but can do the same thing. 

## All my projects are offered “as-is”, without warranty, and disclaiming liability for damages resulting from using this project. use at your own risk. 

# Troubleshooting
if you get an error about indentation use untabify to change all tabs to 4 spaces. 
(I am bad about mixing spaces and tabs, and have to run untabify to fix problems occationally.)
Good Luck!
