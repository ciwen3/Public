# Requirements:
1. Python 3 (check in a terminal by running: python --version)
2. Pillow (PIL) for Python

## Executable
### Warning: I have also made an Executable .exe for the Steganography program however Microsoft Defender Flags that as Malicious because it is not signed. 

# Steganogrphy Decode and Run PoC:
## Use:
1. Run program followed by the name of the picture you want to decode and run commands from. 
2. ``` Steganography-Poc.py /path/to/picture/to/decode ```
3. wait for program to run. 

## Example Decode and Run on Linux option 1:
1. ``` chmod +x Steganography-Poc ```
2. ``` Steganography-Poc redheart-firefox.PNG ```
3. if firefox is installed it should open. 

## Example Decode and Run on Linux option 2:
1. ``` chmod +x Steganography-Poc.py ```
2. ``` Steganography-Poc.py redheart-firefox.PNG ```
3. if firefox is installed it should open. 

## Example Decode and Run on Linux option 3:
1. ```python3 Steganography-Poc.py redheart-firefox.PNG ```
2. if firefox is installed it should open. 

## Example Decode and Run on Windows option 1:
1. ``` python Steganography-Poc.py redheart-calc.PNG ```
2. Caclulator should open.  

## Example Decode and Run on Windows option 2:
1. drag and drop redheart-calc.PNG onto Steganography-Poc.exe
2. Caclulator should open. 

## Example Decode and Run on Windows option 3:
1. Open CMD or PowerShell
2. ``` Steganography-Poc.exe redheart-calc.PNG ```
3. Caclulator should open. 

## Troubleshooting
if you get an error about indentation use untabify to change all tabs to 4 spaces. 
(I am bad about mixing spaces and tabs, and have to run untabify to fix problems occationally.)
Good Luck!
