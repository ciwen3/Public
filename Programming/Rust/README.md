    We can create a project using 'cargo new'.
    We can build a project using 'cargo build'.
    We can build and run a project in one step using 'cargo run'.
    We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using 'cargo check'.
    Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
    When your project is finally ready for release, you can use 'cargo build --release' to compile it with optimizations. 
    'cargo doc --open' command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If youâ€™re interested in other functionality in the rand crate, for example, run cargo doc --open and click rand in the sidebar on the left.
