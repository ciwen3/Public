## Compile Rust Code
```bash
rustc main.rs
```

# Anatomy of a Rust Program
## main function
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html
```rust
fn main() {

}
```
 - The fn syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, (), indicate there are no parameters; and the curly bracket, {, starts the body of the function.
 - () Parameters goes inside the parentheses
 - {} Function body goes inside the curly brackets. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. 

## comment
```rust
// everything after a double slash is ignored by the compiler
```

# Formatted print
## println!
```rust
	println!("Some Text Here");
```
 - println! calls a Rust Macro to print text to the screen
 - println (without the !) calls a normal function 
Examples:
```rust
    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```
Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in std::fmt some of which include:
 - format!: write formatted text to String
 - print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
 - println!: same as print! but a newline is appended.
 - eprint!: same as print! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
 - eprintln!: same as eprint! but a newline is appended.





## prelude: import library
```rust
use std::io;
```
 - To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the io input/output library into scope. The io library comes from the standard library, known as std:

## variables
```rust
    let mut guess = String::new();
```
 - let statement to create the variable.
 -  variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won‚Äôt change. 
 - The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an associated function of the String type. An associated function is a function that‚Äôs implemented on a type, in this case String. This new function creates a new, empty string. You‚Äôll find a new function on many types because it‚Äôs a common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.
 ```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable: object whose state CANNOT be modified after it is created; unchangeable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable: object whose state CAN be modified after it is created; changeable
 ```

## constants
```
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```
 - values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change
 - You declare constants using the ```const``` keyword instead of the ```let``` keyword, and the type of the value must be annotated
 - naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words ```THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS```

## shadowing
```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
 - declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable

```
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
```
 - The first spaces variable is a string type and the second spaces variable is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name. However, if we try to use mut for this, as shown here, we‚Äôll get a compile-time error:
```
    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();
```

## data types
### scalar types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

### integer types
 - type declaration indicates that the value it‚Äôs associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space. 

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit| i128   | u128     |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |

 - isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.
 - unsigned: will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign
 - signed: possible for the number to be negative‚Äîin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (plus sign or a minus sign)

| Number literals | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| Decimal | 98_222 |
| Hex | 0xff |
| Octal | 0o77 |
| Binary | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only) | b'A' |

- Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, to designate the type. Number literals can also use _ as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if you had specified 1000.

### floating-point types
floating-point numbers are numbers with decimal points
```
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```
 - f32 32 bits in size
 - f64 64 bits in size
 - default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision
 - all floating-point types are signed

### numeric operations types
```
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```
 - supports the basic mathematical operations you‚Äôd expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder
 - integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer

### boolean types
```
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

### character types
```
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```
 - Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes
 - ```char``` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII

## Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### tuple type
tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. 
```
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```
 - have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size
 - create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses
 - each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don‚Äôt have to be the same
```
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```


```
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

### array type
```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```
 - every element of an array must have the same type 
 - unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
```
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```

```
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
 - write an array‚Äôs type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array
 - i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements

```
let a = [3; 5];
```
 - array named a will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially
 - this is the same as writing let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]; but in a more concise way

```
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```
 - variable named ```first``` will get the value 1 because that is the value at index [0] in the array
 - variable named ```second``` will get the value 2 from index [1] in the array


## functions
```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
 - ```fn``` keyword allows you to declare new functions
 - ```fn``` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends

### parameters/arguments
```
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
 - are special variables that are part of a function‚Äôs signature 
 - when a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters
 - The declaration of another_function has one parameter named x
 - The type of x is specified as i32
 - When we pass 5 in to another_function, the println! macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets containing x was in the format string
 - in function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter

```
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
```

### statements 
 - function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression
 - statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value
 - expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Let‚Äôs look at some examples
```
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```
 - creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the let keyword is a statement
 - function definitions are also statements
 - statements do not return values

### expressions
 - ***if you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value***
 - expressions evaluate to a value 
 - ```let y = 6;``` is an expression that evaluates to the value 6 
 - calling a function is an expression
 - calling a macro is an expression
 - a new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression

```
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```
 - in this case, evaluates to 4
 - that value gets bound to y as part of the let statement
 - note that the x + 1 line doesn‚Äôt have a semicolon at the end
 - if you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value

### functions with return values
```
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
 - functions can return values to the code that calls them
 - we don‚Äôt name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (->)
 - the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function
 - can return early from a function by using the ```return``` keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly



```
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```
 1. x is equal to the return value of plus_one after being run with the parameter/argument 5
 2. function plus_one declares the parameter/arguement as variable x and that it is a signed 32bit integer
 3. print the line with the returned value of x

## if expression

```
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```


```
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

### using if in a let statement
```
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
 - ```number``` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the ```if``` expression
 - results from each arm of the ```if``` must be the same type

## loop
```
loop {}
```
 - will rerun the code between the {} forever or until there is an exit condition

 ```
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
 ```

### returning values from loops
```
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```
- you can add the value you want returned after the break expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it

### loop labels to disambiguate between multiple loops
If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with break or continue to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote.
```
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```
 - the outer loop has the label 'counting_up, and it will count up from 0 to 2
 - the inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9
 - the first break that doesn‚Äôt specify a label will exit the inner loop only
 - the break 'counting_up; statement will exit the outer loop

### conditional loops with while
A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, the program calls break, stopping the loop. It‚Äôs possible to implement behavior like this using a combination of loop, if, else, and break. However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a while loop. This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used loop, if, else, and break, and it‚Äôs clearer. 

```
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
 - while a condition evaluates to true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop

### looping through a collection with for

```
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```
 - use the while construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array

```
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```
 - less error prone than the example above it 

```
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
 - ```rev``` to reverse the range

## break
```
break;
```
 - makes the program exit the loop

## user input
```rust
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
```
 - the input/output functionality from the standard library with ```use std::io;```
 - If we hadn‚Äôt imported the io library with use std::io; at the beginning of the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as std::io::stdin. 
 - ```.read_line(&mut guess)``` calls the read_line method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. 
 - passing ```&mut guess``` as the argument to read_line to tell it what string to store the user input in.
 - read_line is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string 
 - The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string‚Äôs content.
 - ```&``` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.
 - references are immutable by default. Hence, you need to write &mut guess rather than &guess to make it mutable. 

## handling potential failure with result
```rust
        .expect("Failed to read line");
```
We could have written this code as:
```rust
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
```
 - often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long lines when you call a method with the .method_name() syntax. 
 - read_line puts whatever the user enters into the string we pass to it, but it also returns a Result value.

## convert variable type
```
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```
Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of guess with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables

 - ```trim()``` method on a String instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end
 - ```parse()``` method on strings converts a string to another type
 - ```let guess: u32``` The colon (:) after guess tells Rust we‚Äôll annotate the variable‚Äôs type

## continue
```
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
	Ok(num) => num,
	Err(_) => continue,
};
```
 - ```continue``` which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the loop 
 - in this example it asks for another guess when an error like a non integer is input occurs 

## catch all
```
Err(_)
```
 - ```_``` is a catchall value; in this example, we‚Äôre saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them





# CommandLine Arguments
CommandLine arguments are passed to a program before executing it. They are like parameters passed to functions. CommandLine parameters can be used to pass values to the main() function. The std::env::args() returns the commandline arguments.

The following example passes values as commandLine arguments to the main() function. The program is created in a file name main.rs.

```rust
//main.rs
fn main(){
   let cmd_line = std::env::args();
   println!("No of elements in arguments is :{}",cmd_line.len()); 
   //print total number of values passed
   for arg in cmd_line {
      println!("[{}]",arg); //print all values passed 
      as commandline arguments
   }
}
```

The program will generate a file main.exe once compiled. Multiple command line parameters should be separated by space. Execute main.exe from the terminal as main.exe hello tutorialspoint.

NOTE ‚àí hello and tutorialspoint are commandline arguments.

Output:
```
No of elements in arguments is :3
[main.exe]
[hello]
[tutorialspoint]
```
The output shows 3 arguments as the main.exe is the first argument.




# Math
The following program calculates the sum of values passed as commandline arguments. A list integer values separated by space is passed to program.
```rust
fn main(){
   let cmd_line = std::env::args();
   println!("No of elements in arguments is 
   :{}",cmd_line.len()); 
   // total number of elements passed

   let mut sum = 0;
   let mut has_read_first_arg = false;

   //iterate through all the arguments and calculate their sum

   for arg in cmd_line {
      if has_read_first_arg { //skip the first argument since it is the exe file name
         sum += arg.parse::<i32>().unwrap();
      }
      has_read_first_arg = true; 
      // set the flag to true to calculate sum for the subsequent arguments.
   }
   println!("sum is {}",sum);
}
```

On executing the program as main.exe 1 2 3 4, the output will be ‚àí
```
No of elements in arguments is :5
sum is 10
```
