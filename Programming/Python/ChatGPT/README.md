This is code I got ChatGPT to help me write. 




[ping.py](https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/blob/master/Python/ChatGPT/ping.py): this program is a basic gui to do a ping using python socket. it works fine on Linux but has some issues with Windows. On Windows you must run as Administrator and will only allow you to put a 1 in the ping count field or else it will return an error. On windows it will always send 4 ICMP packets.
