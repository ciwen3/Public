This code is the same as the previous example, except that it adds the numbers 2 and 3 to the results list at the beginning, before the while loop starts. This means that the numbers 2 and 3 will be included in the results list, along with all of the other numbers that meet the criteria.
```
results = [2, 3]
i = 1
while True:
    if (i % 6 == 1) or (i % 6 == 5):
        results.append(i)
    i += 1
```

This code defines a generator function called generate_numbers that will yield the numbers from 1 to infinity that are divided by 6 and have a remainder of 1 or 5. 
```
def generate_numbers():
    i = 1
    while True:
        if (i % 6 == 1) or (i % 6 == 5):
            yield i
        i += 1
```
To use this generator function, you can call it like this:
```
for number in generate_numbers():
    # Do something with the number
```




```
import math

def generate_numbers():
    i = 1
    while True:
        if (i % 6 == 1) or (i % 6 == 5):
            yield i
        i += 1

results = [2, 3]
for number in generate_numbers():
    if math.isqrt(number)**2 == number:
        results.append(number)
```
