I helped a company with an infection, we figured out it was known as [XCSSET](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0658/). In my research of the Malware we found and the information online I put together a script to systematically download each version of the Malware from each server they have check its SHA256 hash against a list of already downloaded malware and if it is unique (to me) upload it to virus total.
