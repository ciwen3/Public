Yes, this code can be improved in a few ways. Here are some suggestions:

The program currently uses the system() function to execute command-line utilities. While this is fine for simple programs like this one, it can be dangerous to use in larger, more complex programs. Instead of using system(), consider using a safer alternative like CreateProcess() from the Windows API.
The program uses printf() to print strings to the console. In C++, it is more common to use the std::cout object from the <iostream> standard library header for printing. This will allow you to use the << operator to concatenate strings and variables, which is more readable and easier to use than the printf() function.
The program uses the using namespace std directive, which imports all of the names from the std namespace into the global namespace. While this can make it easier to write code, it can also lead to naming conflicts if the code uses two different identifiers with the same name. It is generally considered better practice to explicitly qualify names from the std namespace, for example by writing std::cout instead of just cout.
The program includes a #include for the <cstdlib> standard library header, but does not actually use any of the functions or types defined in that header. You can remove this #include to avoid unnecessary code bloat.
The program includes a cin statement to read the process ID from the user, but does not check whether the user actually entered a valid number. If the user enters something other than a number, the program will crash. It would be better to use the std::stoi() function to convert the user input to an integer, and check whether the conversion was successful before using the value.
The program uses the findstr command-line utility to filter the output of the wmic command. Instead of using findstr, you can use the grep command, which is included with Windows 10 by default. This will make the code more portable and easier to read.
Here is an example of how the code could be improved:
```
 #include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>
#include <cstring>  // for CreateProcess()
#include <windows.h>

// avoid using the global namespace
using namespace std::chrono;

int main()
{
    // print information:
    std::cout << "This Program was created by Christopher Iwen AKA Strat0m\n"
              << "to find unquoted path vulnerabilities in Windows programs\n"
              << "you can download the source code for this at "
              << "https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/tree/master/C%2B%2B/Unquoted-Path-Vuln\n\n";
    
    // print timestamp
    auto t = system_clock::to_time_t(system_clock::now());
    std::cout << "TimeStamp: " << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), "%c %Z") << '\n';

    // run commands:
    std::cout << "\n\nUser this command was run as:\n";
    system("whoami");
    std::cout << '\n';
    
    system("whoami /priv");
    std::cout << '\n';
    
    std::cout << "To find the command that called Program.exe run:\n"
              << "wmic process where name='program.exe' get commandline\n";
    system("wmic process where name='program.exe' get commandline");
    std::cout << '\n';
    
    std::cout << "To find the process ID for the command that called Program.exe run:\n"
              << "wmic process where name='program.exe' get parentprocessid\n";
    system("wmic process where name='program.exe' get parentprocessid");
    std::cout << '\n';
    
    // read process ID from user
    std::string pid;
    std::cout << "Type the number that was returned by the last command: ";
    std::cin >> pid;

    // check if input is valid
    try {
        int pid_int = std::stoi(pid);
        if (pid_int != 0) {
            std::cout << "To find the location of the Program that called Program.exe run:\n"
                      << "wmic process where processid=" << pid << " get commandline\n";
            std::string command = "wmic process where processid=" + pid + " get commandline";
            system(command.c_str());
            std::cout << '\n';
        } else {
            std::cout << '\n';
        }
    } catch (const std::exception&) {
        std::cout << "Invalid input.\n";
    }

    // run command to find programs with unquoted path vulnerabilities
    std::cout << "To find Installed Programs that have un-quoted path vulnerabilites:\n"
              << "wmic service get name, pathname, displayname, startmode | grep -v /i "C:\\Windows\\\\" | grep -v /i """\n";
    system("wmic service get name, pathname, displayname, startmode | grep -v /i "C:\\Windows\\\\" | grep -v /i """");
    std::cout << '\n';

    // pause the program before exiting
    std::cout << "Press any key to continue...";
    std::cin.ignore();
    std::cin.get();

    return 0;
}
```
