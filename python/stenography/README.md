# Use:
1. Run program
2. A) Type E or Encrypt to add text to a picture
2. B) Type D or Decrypt to pull text from a picture
3. Input options (ie. text to hide, output photo and/or input photo)
4. Get Photo with hidden message when Encryopting or get hidden message from photo when Decrypting. 


# To Do:
1. add check to make sure message will fit in the number of pixel found in the picture
2. add begining and end notifiers for text
3. add option to create picture from scratch (possible just a solid color)?? (still debating)
4. make graphical interface using Tkinter


# Troubleshooting
if you get an error about indentation use untabify to change all tabs to 4 spaces. 
(I am bad about mixing spaces and tabs, and have to run untabify to fix problems occationally.)
Good Luck!
