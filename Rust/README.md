# Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager
When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

build your project with 
```
cargo build
```

run your project with 
```
cargo run
```

test your project with 
```
cargo test
```

build documentation for your project with 
```
cargo doc
```

publish a library to crates.io with 
```
cargo publish
```

To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:
```
cargo --version
```
